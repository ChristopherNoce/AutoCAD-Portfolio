# AutoCAD-Portfolio
A place to store all of my AutoCAD projects

I have learned AutoCAD through a LinkedIn Learning course - Learning AutoCAD (2022), as well as through course content in CHE181 (Chemical Engineering Design Studio II).
This repo is a place for me to put all my projects and showcase my progress.
