# AutoCAD-Portfolio
A place to store all of my AutoCAD projects

I have learned AutoCAD through a LinkedIn Learning course - Learning AutoCAD (2022), as well as through course content in CHE181 (Chemical Engineering Design Studio II).
This repo is a place for me to put all my projects and showcase my progress.

In this folder, you will find my CHE181 course work. Below is a description of each assignment

- Assignment 1: Given a drawing of a 3 Valve Pipette Filler Bulb and was tasked to recreate it --> learned the fundamentals of AutoCAD
- Assignment 2: Given a drawing of a Mass Flow Meter and was tasked to recreate it --> Learned how to make more detailed part drawings with multiple views
- Assignment 3: Was given a 3D printed model of a stopcock. I was tasked with measuring the dimensions using a vernier caliper and making the drawing from scratch --> Learned more about making part drawings and built on my pre-existing knowledge of how to use precision measurement tools.
- Assugnment 4: Was tasked to recreate a P&ID for a nitrogen tank in front of the Engineerineg 6 building at the University of Waterloo --> Learned about P&IDs and how to use AutoCAD Plant 3D
